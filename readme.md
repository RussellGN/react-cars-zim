# Cars.zim is a platform for advertising used vehicles

This repository holds the code for the frontend of the website, built entirely
using React.

## The frontentd is far from complete!

Apart from being incomplete, this project is just proof of concept and is more aimed
torwads at showcasing knowledge and proficiency in React and web development in general.

## there is no backend as of yet

All data on the site is fabricated and staticly served. I intend to build the backend sevice for
the website after completion of the frontend.

# Packages used

1. Material UI
2. React router dom
3. Material Icons

# current state

Base routes, structure and components complete, ongoing refinement.
